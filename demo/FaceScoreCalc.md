Reading Fourier Spectra: It reads the Fourier-transformed data (model and human spectra) from the specified files using Pandas.

Computing FACE Scores: Currently, this function contains placeholders for calculating various FACE metrics like Pearson Correlation (CORR), Spearman Rank Correlation (SPEAR), Spectral Overlap (SO), and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). The actual implementation for these calculations will be filled in later.

Outputting FACE Scores: Saves the calculated FACE scores to a file or prints them to the console, depending on whether an output file path is provided.

Argument Parsing: argparse to handle input file paths for model and human spectra, and an optional output file path.

Synthesizing the results of the entropy sequence generation and Fourier transformation into actionable metrics. The placeholders in the compute_face_scores function will later be replaced with the actual logic for computing the FACE metrics.

Run this script by providing paths to the model and human Fourier spectra files, and optionally, a path to save the FACE scores.
