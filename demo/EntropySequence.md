1.  **Reading Entropy Sequences**: The script reads entropy sequences from a file, where each line in the file is a single entropy value.
2.  **Applying Fourier Transformation**: It applies Fourier transformation to these entropy sequences using `scipy.fft`. This process converts the time-domain data (entropy sequences) into the frequency domain, represented by frequency (`freq`) and the corresponding Fourier-transformed values (`fft_values`).
3.  **Saving the Transformed Data**: Saves the Fourier-transformed data to an output file. Each line in this output file will contain a frequency and its corresponding power value.
4.  **Argument Parsing**: The script uses `argparse` to handle input and output file paths, allowing flexibility and ease of use from the command line.

Prepares the entropy data for the FACE score calculation in the next step.Run this script by providing the paths to the input file (containing entropy sequences) and the output file (where the Fourier-transformed data will be saved).


generate_entropy_sequences.py (based on run_entropy.py and run_entropy_batch.py)

Status: Initial template set up.

Next Steps: Fully implement the script, ensuring compatibility with our models and testing it with actual model outputs.

### Entropy Sequence Generation

#### Key Functions and Their Roles

1.  **create_parser()**:
    -   Creates and configures an argument parser for the script.
    -   Handles command line arguments for input/output files, model details, batch size, and start batch.
2.  **load_model(model_name, model_path)**:
    -   Loads the specified model and tokenizer using Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
    -   `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` and `AutoTokenizer` are used, which allows flexibility in model choice.
3.  **calculate_entropy(logits, labels, mask)**:
    -   Calculates the entropy of the model's predictions.
    -   Uses log softmax and negative log-likelihood loss (NLLLoss).
    -   Applies a mask to focus on relevant parts of the sequence.
4.  **process(model, tokenizer, args)**:
    -   Main processing function.
    -   Reads input data, divides it into batches, and processes each batch to calculate entropy.
    -   Outputs the calculated entropy to a file.

#### Script Execution Flow

-   The script starts by parsing command-line arguments to configure the run.
-   The specified model and tokenizer are loaded.
-   The input text data is processed in batches, with each batch's entropy being calculated and written to the output file.
